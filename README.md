Copy the code from `main.js` into a new script in [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), save it, and reload [CS-108 EPFL](https://cs108.epfl.ch/).

## Troubleshooting

- By default Tampermonkey might not have **userscripts** enabled (I think this a Chromium browsers problem only, to check if you're running a Chromium based browser check [this link](https://hotwraith.github.io/chrome)), this prevents the script from executing correctly. You can follow [this tutorial](https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php?locale=en#Q209) to enable them and fix the script.
